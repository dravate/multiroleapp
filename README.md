1. **Multiple Role-Based Users**  
   - Built with Django's `AbstractUser` class for maximum flexibility.

   - Remembers the **last active role** after login.  
   - Allows smooth switching between roles without multiple logins.

3. **Django + Nuxt Integration**

   - Frontend: Nuxt.js (latest version)  
   - Demonstrates how to connect a modern frontend with a Django backend.

4. **Real-World Use Cases**  
   - Platforms like **Upwork** (both job providers and seekers)  
   - Marketplaces with buyer/seller dual roles  
   - Educational platforms with student/teacher roles
